# Online-Shopping-Sytem

Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows
consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet
using a web browser. Here we have developed an Online Shopping
System with the help of Java for Frontend and Oracle Database
Management System in the Backend.

Online Shopping System provides an user friendly Interactive system from
which users can buy goods. This System allows the user to buy different
kinds of goods from the System and it will maintain a record for that
user.

In this Shopping System the Admin of the System can add different
Categories in the System and he/she can also add different products under
that particular category.
